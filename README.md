# My_coding
**The way I code**

Be slow
Be mindful about every single step you do
**Think fast
Move slow**
Check your code in Debug mode
Mindfully lay down the stepping stones for 
Each short line of the code
So he can run on the pavement without tripping over a mistake
But first and foremost, break down into pieces
Problem into small tasks
Which you can handle gently and carry on your arms
Imagine the pavement 
Each task is a step
Go slowly
Think fast.
